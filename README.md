# Account Creator
This will be a program that allows a user to sign-up for an imaginary company or log in if credentials are already stored.
The user is prompted with a small menu to either sign-up or login. 
If the user signs up, their account information is added to a MySQL table.
If the user logs in, their credentials are cross-checked with the data in the MySQL table, approving or denying 
their access depending on the validity of their account.
